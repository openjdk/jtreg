help.mode.desc=\
    When the JavaTest harness is used to run tests, two possibly different \
    versions of the JDK are used: the JDK version used to run the harness \
    and the JDK version used to run the test(s).  \
    The following options provide a means to specify the \
    JDK version used to run the tests.  The default is to use the same JDK \
    version (provided by JAVA_HOME) for both the harness and the tests, \
    and for each test to run in its own JVM.\n
help.mode.ovm.desc=Run every test in its own JVM.  The JDK version for the \
    tests may be specified via the -testjdk option.  If \
    not provided, then the JDK version specified by the \
    JAVA_HOME environment variable will be used.
help.mode.s.desc=If possible, run each test in the same JVM as the \
    JavaTest harness. \
    The JDK version used may be specified with -testjdk.  If \
    -testjdk is not provided, then the JDK version will be \
    determined by the environment variable JT_JAVA if it is \
    set.  Otherwise, the environment variable JAVA_HOME is \
    used.
help.mode.avm.desc=Run tests using a pool of reusable JVMs.

help.select.name=Test Selection Options

    Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in "at-files". \
    Place the options and/or tests in a file and specify the name of the \
    file on the command line with @file. \
    Options or tests that include white space should be enclosed within \
    either single or double quote characters. \
    Comments may be included in the file by prefixing them with '#'. \
    To specify an option beginning with '@' on the command line, use "@@" \
    to avoid @file expansion.\n

help.tests.groups.name=Groups
help.tests.groups.desc=A test suite may define named groups of tests. \
    To specify the name of a group of tests on the command line, \
    use test-suite-dir:group-name, where test-suite-dir is a path to the \
    root directory of the test suite (i.e the directory containing the \
    TEST.ROOT file), and where group-name is the name of the group of tests \
    defined in the test suite. If test-suite-dir is omitted it defaults \
    to the value of the -dir option, if given, or to the current directory \
    otherwise.\n\
    (Note: on Windows, to avoid confusion with absolute path names including \
    a drive specifier, the test-suite-dir must not be specified with a \
    relative path consisting of a single letter.)\n\n\
    Groups are defined in a test suite using one or more Java properties files. \
    The names of these files must be listed in the "groups" entry in TEST.ROOT. \
    If the filename is enclosed in square brackets, no error message will be \
    given if the file cannot be found. Within the property files, each entry \
    specifies items to be included or excluded from the group. To include a test \
    or directory of tests, simply specify the name of the test or directory. \
    To exclude a test or directory of tests, use '-' followed by the name of \
    the test or directory.  To include the contents of another group, \
    use ':' followed by the name of the group. There must be no spaces between \
    the "-" or ":" and the name that follows.

    may be given to select the type of output desired.
