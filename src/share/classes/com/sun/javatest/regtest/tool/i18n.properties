    for details. For example, -o:SampleRegressionObserver
help.main.od.desc=Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which \
    the observer class is located.  The given pathname is simply appended to the \
    CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus care should be taken when naming an \
    observer not to collide with the names of classes internal to the JavaTest \

help.mode.name=Test Mode Options
help.mode.desc=\
    Each test consists of a series of steps, called actions. The jtreg harness \
    provides different modes, which determine the JVM to use to execute \
    each action. The default is to run each action in a new JVM.\n
help.mode.ovm.desc=Execute every action in a new JVM. This is the default. \
    It provides the maximum isolation between actions, at a significant \
    cost in performance.\n\
    The JDK to use can be specified with -testjdk or -jdk, except \
    for @compile actions, which use -compilejdk or -jdk. If values \
    are not provided, the environment variable JAVA_HOME is used.
help.mode.avm.desc=Execute each action using a pool of reusable JVMs, \
    except when an action specifies otherwise. \
    It provides good performance, and reasonable isolation between \
    actions: if a JVM can be reset to a standard state after it has \
    been used, it will be returned to the pool for reuse; otherwise, \
    it will be discarded and replaced if and when necessary. \
    This mode is generally recommended for all use.\n\
    The JDK to use can be specified with -testjdk or -jdk, except \
    for @compile actions, which use -compilejdk or -jdk. If values \
    are not provided, the environment variable JAVA_HOME is used.

help.pool.name=Agent Pool Options
help.pool.desc=\
    Options to configure the size of the pool of VMs used to execute \
    tests in agent mode.
help.pool.max_pool_size.arg=<number>

     The default is either 2x the concurrency.
help.pool.pool_idle_timeout.arg=<number>
help.pool.pool_idle_timeout.desc=\
     The time, in seconds, before an idle VM in the pool is \
     automatically closed.
help.pool.agent_attempts.arg=<number>
help.pool.agent_attempts.desc=\
    The number of attempts jtreg will make to access an agent \
    with the desired characteristics, either by creating a new one, \
    or obtaining one from the pool of reusable VMs. The minimum value, \
    and the default value, is 1.

help.select.name=Test Selection Options
help.select.desc=These options can be used to refine the set of tests to \
    be executed.\n
help.select.a.desc=Any test with /manual will not be run

help.select.bug.arg=<bugid>
help.select.exclude.desc=Provide a file specifying tests that should not be run
help.select.exclude.arg=<file>

    expression can contain keyword names, combined with & (and), | (or), \
    ! (not) and parentheses.

    (inverse of -exclude)

help.select.status.arg=<value>,...
help.select.shell.desc=Only tests which contain shell actions will be run
help.select.status.desc=Select tests according to their result in an earlier \
    run. The value can be one or more of the following values, separated by commas.

help.select.status.fail.desc=Tests that failed
help.select.status.notRun.desc=Tests that have not been run
help.select.status.error.desc=Tests that could not be run because of errors, or tests that were ignored

help.tests.name=Tests
help.tests.desc=Specifying collections of tests.\n

help.tests.at.name=at-files
help.tests.at.desc=\
    Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in "at-files". \
    Place the options and/or tests in a file and specify the name of the \
    file on the command line with @file. \
    Options or tests that include white space should be enclosed within \
    either single or double quote characters. \
    Comments may be included in the file by prefixing them with '#'. \
    To specify an option beginning with '@' on the command line, use "@@" \
    to avoid @file expansion.\n

help.tests.groups.name=Groups
help.tests.groups.desc=A test suite may define named groups of tests. \
    To specify the name of a group of tests on the command line, \
    use test-suite-dir:group-name, where test-suite-dir is a path to the \
    root directory of the test suite (that is, the directory containing the \
    TEST.ROOT file), and where group-name is the name of the group of tests \
    defined in the test suite. If test-suite-dir is omitted it defaults \
    to the value of the -dir option, if given, or to the current directory \
    otherwise.\n\
    (Note: on Windows, to avoid confusion with absolute path names including \
    a drive specifier, the test-suite-dir must not be specified with a \
    relative path consisting of a single letter.)\n\n\
    Groups are defined in a test suite using one or more Java properties files. \
    The names of these files must be listed in the "groups" entry in TEST.ROOT. \
    If the filename is enclosed in square brackets, no error message will be \
    given if the file cannot be found. Within the property files, each entry \
    specifies items to be included or excluded from the group. To include a test \
    or directory of tests, simply specify the name of the test or directory. \
    To exclude a test or directory of tests, use '-' followed by the name of \
    the test or directory.  To include the contents of another group, \
    use ':' followed by the name of the group. There must be no spaces between \
    the "-" or ":" and the name that follows.

help.tests.summary.name=Summary
help.tests.summary.desc=\
    The following kinds of arguments can be used to specify tests to be executed.\
    In these examples, square brackets are used to indicate optional parts.

help.tests.summary.at-file.name=@file
help.tests.summary.at-file.desc=\
    A file containing values to be treated as if on the command-line.

help.tests.summary.group.name=[path]:group-name
help.tests.summary.group.desc=\
    A group of tests, as defined in the TEST.groups file in the testsuite root \
    directory.  If given, path specifies the testsuite root directory. If not \
    given, it defaults to the one enclosing the current directory.

help.tests.summary.directory.name=directory
help.tests.summary.directory.desc=\
    All tests found in and under the given directory.

help.tests.summary.file.name=file[#id][?string]
help.tests.summary.file.desc=\
    Either all tests in the given file if no id is given, or the specified \
    test if an id is given. A file contains multiple tests if there are \
    multiple test descriptions, in separate comment blocks.\n\
    If '?string' is specified, the string will be passed to the test \
    so that it may filter the parts of the test to be executed. \
    The string will typically be the name of a method to be executed.\n\
    If conflicting values for the string are given for a specific test, \
    the last one given will be used.

help.timeout.name=Timeout Options
help.timeout.desc=These options control the behavior when tests run longer than their \
   specified timeout value.
help.timeout.th.desc=Specifies the class to handle timeouts. The class must extend \
    com.sun.javatest.regtest.TimeoutHandler. For example, -th:MyHandler
help.timeout.th.arg=<classname>
help.timeout.thd.desc=Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which \
    the timeout handler class is located.  The given pathname is simply appended to the \
    CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus care should be taken when naming a \
    timeout handler not to collide with the names of classes internal to the JavaTest \
    harness or the JRE. For example, put the timeout handler class in its own named package.
help.timeout.thd.arg=<path>
help.timeout.thtimeout.desc=Specifies execution time limitation for the timeout \
    handler. If the timeout handler does not finish its actions within the \
    specified period of time, it will be interrupted. Non-positive values mean \
    no limitation. The default value is 5 minutes (300 seconds).
help.timeout.thtimeout.arg=<#seconds>
help.timeout.timeout.desc=A scaling factor to extend the default timeout of all \
    tests.  Typically used when running tests on slow systems or systems with \
    slow file systems.

    value. The comparison is done against any values specified in the test, \
    before any timeout factor is applied.

help.verbose.desc=These options control the amount of output written to the \
    console while running tests\n
