help.compare.desc=
help.compare.r.desc=Include the reason string in the comparison, as well as \
    the type (i.e. Passed, Failed, etc.)
help.compare.s.desc=Perform a "super-diff" looking for result sets within \
    a directory hierarchy. The hierarchy must be arranged as \
    follows: PATH/PLATFORM/YEAR/DAY_OF_YEAR/TEST_RESULTS, where PATH is \
    given by the single directory argument, PLATFORM is the name of the \
    platform on which the tests were run, YEAR and DAY_OF_YEAR are numbers \
    identifying when the tests were run, and TESTSUITE_RESULTS is a fixed string \
    identifying when to find the result set in the hierarchy. The default \
    is "JTreport/text/summary.txt", but it can be set to a different value by \
    setting the system property "jtdiff.super.testResults". It may identify any \
    source of results acceptable to a standard invocation of jtdiff. \
    Set system property jtdiff.html.compact=true for a more output format, with \
    symbols replacing the words "pass" (check mark), "fail" (cross), "error" \
    (cross in a circle), and "not run" (horizontal bar).
