<h2 id="LEADING_COMMENTS">LEADING COMMENTS AND DEFINING FILES</h2>

<p>A particular test may involve several files of various types, but the test is
specified in just one of them.  Let this be called the <dfn>defining file</dfn> of the
test.

<p>The defining file of a test may be one of several types of files.  Test tags
must be enclosed in a comment at the head of the file, optionally preceded by
comments which do not contain test tags.  The comment in the defining file
which includes the test tags is called the <dfn>leading comment</dfn>.  The following
types of defining files are recognized:

<ul>
<li>
    A Java source file, with file extension ".java".  Only the "<code>/*</code>" to "<code>*/</code>"
    comment syntax is recognized.  On each comment line leading asterisks, if
    any, are ignored.

<li>
    A Bourne shell file, with file extension ".sh".  The leading comment is the
    first contiguous set of lines each of whose first character is '#'.  The
    comment is terminated by the first line whose first character is not '#'.
    Note that shell tests should not contain "#!/bin/sh" on the first line;
    they are intended to be run only via explicit invocation of a shell.

<li>
    An HTML file, with file extension ".html".  The leading comment is enclosed
    within the usual "<code>&lt;!--</code>" to "<code>--&gt;</code>" HTML tag.
</ul>

<p>The contents of a leading comment are parsed into a sequence of tokens.  A
token is a maximal contiguous sequence of non-whitespace characters.
Whitespace characters, which include newline and carriage-return characters,
are significant only insofar as they separate tokens.

<p>Some files within the source directory structure may be configured to
implicitly be defining files. For all other files, the first token in the
leading comment in the defining file of a test must be "<code>@test</code>".
The harness discovers defining files by looking for such tokens: a file
without comments is not a defining file; a file whose leading comment
does not start with "<code>@test</code>" is not a defining file.


<h2 id="TAG_SYNTAX">TAG SYNTAX</h2>

<p>Within a leading comment, a tag consists of a tag token followed by some number
of arguments.  A tag token is any token whose first character is '@'.  There is
at present no syntax for quoting a leading '@' character.  Case is significant
when comparing tag tokens; all tag tokens defined here are in lower case.  It
is an error for the leading comment of a defining file to contain any tag token
not defined here.

<p>As a special case, the token "<code>@(#)</code>" is not treated as a tag token.
For historical reasons, this token may appear in the arguments to an
<code>@test</code> tag as part of an SCCS identification string.

<p>The arguments of a tag are simply the tokens that follow it.  The argument
tokens of a tag extend from the first token after the tag token to the end of
the comment, the end of the file, or the next tag token, whichever comes first.
Argument tokens are separated by whitespace; if commas are used, they will be
considered to be part of the tokens to which they are adjacent.

<p>The arguments of a tag may contain references to various properties, using
the syntax <code>${<var>&lt;name&gt;</var>}</code>.
The set of names is the same as the set that may be used in an
<code>@requires</code> expression, and is defined in <a href="#requires_names">Appendix 1</a>.
<span class="note">
Note: For compatibility reasons, this feature is only enabled by default
when the test suite declares a <a href="#requiredVersion">required version</a> of
<code>jtreg 4.2 b14</code> and higher. The feature can be explicitly enabled or disabled
by setting <code><a href="#allowSmartActionArgs">allowSmartActionArgs</a></code> in
the <a href="#config">configuration files</a>.</span>

<h2 id="INFORMATIONAL_TAGS">INFORMATIONAL TAGS</h2>

<p>Informational tags document the test.  They do not affect the operation of the
harness, but may be used by the harness in generating reports.

<dl class="tags">

<dt>@test <var>&lt;token&gt;*</var>
<dd>
<p>Defining-file identifier; in general, <var>&lt;token&gt;*</var> is a comment
and is ignored.

<p>As a special case, if the file contains multiple comments beginning
with <code>@test</code>, if the tokens that follow <code>@test</code> are
<code>id=</code><var>identifier</var>, the identifier will be used to construct
a unique name for the test. If there is no such identifier, a default one will
be used.

<dt>@bug <var>&lt;bugid&gt;+</var>
<dd>
<p>Java bug system numbers

<dt>@summary <var>&lt;token&gt;+</var>
<dd>
<p>Textual summary

<dt>@author <var>&lt;token&gt;+</var>
<dd>
<p>Original author. Use of this tag is now generally discouraged;
information about the author and other contributions is generally
better left to the source code management system for the test suite.

<dt>@comment <var>&lt;token&gt;*</var>
<dd>
<p>A comment; ignored
</dl>

<p>Any particular informational tag, except the <code>@comment</code> tag, may occur at most
once in a given test. The <code>@comment</code> tag may be used multiple times.


<h2 id="DECLARATIVE_TAGS">DECLARATIVE TAGS</h2>

<p>Declarative tags govern the execution of the tags that follow them.

<dl class="tags">

<dt>@library <var>&lt;path|jar&gt;+</var>
<dd>
<p>Add one or more pathnames or jar filenames to the library path list.
Each argument must use forward slash to separate file name components, and
may use ".." to denote parent directories.

<ul>
<li>If an argument is relative (that is, it does not begin with '/'), it will
    be evaluated relative to the directory containing the test.
    It is an error if the resulting path is outside the test suite.
<li>If an argument begins with '/', it will first be evaluated relative to the
    root directory of the test suite.
    It is an error if the resulting path is outside the test suite.
    If the result does not identify an existing directory, it will be further
    evaluated against each entry of a search path in turn, until an existing
    directory is found.
    The search path is specified by the <code>external.lib.roots</code> entry
    in the test suite <a href="#config">configuration files</a>.
<li>An argument may begin with <code>${java.home}/</code> to refer to libraries
    bundled with the JDK being tested.
    An argument may begin with <code>${jtreg.home}/</code> to refer to libraries
    bundled with the jtreg test harness.
</ul>

<p>It is an error if any of the entries in the library path list does
not identify an existing directory or jar file.

<p>Each entry in the library path list is categorized according to its content.
<ul>
<li><b>packages</b>: the contents are one or more source files arranged in a
    standard package hierarchy.
<li><b>user modules</b>: the contents are one or more directories, each containing
    the complete source code for a user module. Each directory must be named for
    the module it contains, and the directory must directly contain a module declaration
    (<i>module-info.java</i>).
<li><b>system module patch</b>: the contents are one or more directories,
    each containing source files to be compiled and used to patch modules in
    the system image being tested. Each directory must be named for the module
    to be patched, and the directory must <i>not</i> contain a module declaration
    (<i>module-info.java</i> or <i>module-info.class</i>).
    The source files in each directory must be organized in a standard package hierarchy.
<li><b>precompiled jar file</b>: the entry is a jar file containing precompiled
    class files.
</ul>

<p>Configuration information for a library may be specified in a file named
<a href="LIBRARY_PROPERTIES">LIBRARY.properties</a> in the root directory of
the library. A library may be specified to use preview features,
in which case the appropriate compile-time and runtime options will be
provided automatically. This extends to any tests that may use the library.

<p>It is an error if any entry in the library path list cannot be categorized.
In particular, any one entry in the library path cannot contain more than one type of
content.
It is highly recommended that a library directory should only contain content directly
related to the library; it should not contain subdirectories containing other content,
such as tests, or other separate libraries.

<p>In general, classes in library directories are not automatically compiled
as part of a compilation command explicitly naming the source files containing
those classes. A test that relies upon library classes should contain appropriate
<code>@build</code> directives to ensure that the classes will be compiled.
It is strongly recommended that tests do not rely on the use of implicit compilation
by the Java compiler. Such an approach is generally fragile, and may lead to
incomplete recompilation when a test or library code has been modified.

<p>If a library directory is used by a directory of <a href="#TESTNG">TestNG</a> tests,
all the classes in a library directory will be automatically compiled by means of implicit
<code>@build</code> tags.

<p>When the harness compiles a test, the source code for each entry (if any) will be
placed on the appropriate source path, and any previously compiled classes for each entry
will be placed on the class path, application module path or module patch path as
appropriate.
When the harness runs a test, the compiled classes for each entry
will be placed on the class path, application module path or module patch path as
appropriate.

<p>The <code>@library</code> tag may be used more than once.  It may only be used before the
first <code>@run</code> tag (either explicit or implicit.)
Specifically, it must appear before any use of <code>@run</code>, <code>@build</code>,
<code>@compile</code>, and <code>@ignore</code>.

<p>The <code>@library</code> tag and the library path list have nothing to do with the search path
(i.e., the PATH environment variable) defined in shell actions.

<dt>@key <var>&lt;keyword&gt;+</var>
<dd>
<p>Label this test with the given keyword(s).  Some harnesses allow tests to be
selected via boolean expressions on keywords.  The list of acceptable keywords
may be specified in the <a href="#TEST_ROOT">TEST.ROOT</a> file (see below).
The <code>@key</code> tag may be used at most once in a given test.

<dt>@modules <var>&lt;module&gt;[/&lt;package&gt;[:&lt;flag&gt;]]+</var>
<dd>
<p>Express a dependence on modules in the system being tested, and optionally,
on selected internal packages in some or all of those modules.

<p>If no dependencies are specified explicitly, a default set of dependencies will be read
from the <code>modules</code> entry in test suite <a href="#config">configuration files</a>.

<p>The dependencies will be ignored if the version of JDK used to run the tests
does not support the use of modules. Otherwise,
a test will not be run if the system being tested does not contain all the
specified modules. All the specified modules will be present in the configuration
when the test is run.

<p>A flag may be specified to indicate the desired access to a specified
package.
<table>
<thead><tr class="head"><th>Flag</th><th>Access</th></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><i>none</i><td>The package should be exported,
so that its public types will be available for use by the test at compile time and run time.
<tr><td><code>open</code><td>The package should be opened,
so that its types will be available for use by the test at run time using deep reflection.
<tr><td><code>+open</code><td>The package should be both exported and opened,
so that its public types will be available for use by the test at compile time and run time,
and other types will be available at run time using deep reflection.
</table>

<dt>@requires <var>&lt;expression&gt;</var>
<dd>
<p>Express a dependence on characteristics of the system being tested.
Some harnesses allow tests to be selected according to the characteristics
of the system being tested.
The expression may be composed of the following elements:

<ul>
    <li>Named characteristics. See <a href="#requires_names">Appendix 1</a>
        for a complete list of the standard supported names, and details of the
        test-suite <a href="#config">configuration files</a> for information on
        how to extend the set with additional names specific to the test-suite.
    <li>Numeric values. Values must be decimal integers, optionally followed a
        suffix '<code>K</code>', '<code>M</code>' or '<code>G</code>', which is
        a multiplier of 1024, 1024*1024 and 1024*1024*1024 respectively.
        The resulting value must fit in a <code>long</code> variable.
    <li>String values, enclosed in double quotes '"'.
    <li>Boolean values '<code>true</code>' and '<code>false</code>'.
    <li>Operators:
        &nbsp;<code>(&nbsp;)</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>*</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>/</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>%</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>+</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>-</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>==</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>~=</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>&lt;=</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>&gt;</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>&gt;=</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>&amp;</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>|</code>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;<code>!</code>
</ul>
<p>The <code>@requires</code> tag may be used multiple times in a given test.
If it is used more than once, the expressions in the individual instances will
be enclosed in parentheses and combined with '&amp;'.</p>

<dt>@enablePreview <var>[true|false]</var>
<dd>
<p>Declares whether the test code uses "preview features".
Code that uses preview features must be compiled and executed
with additional compile-time and run-time options.
If a test declares that it uses preview features, these additional
options will be provided automatically, for all <code>@run main</code> and
<code>@compile</code> actions, including implicit <code>@compile</code> actions
generated by <code>@build</code> actions.

<p>If the tag is present but no argument given, a default value of
<code>true</code> will be assumed.
If the tag is not present, and a default value has been <a href="#config">configured</a>
with an <code><a href="#enablePreview">enablePreview</a></code> entry
in an enclosing TEST.properties file, then that default value will be used.
If the tag is not present and no default value has been configured,
a value of <code>false</code> will be assumed and no additional
compile-time and run-time options will be provided.

<p>If a test uses any libraries that use preview features,
the test will be assumed to also use preview features.

<p>There is no requirement to use <code>@enablePreview</code>.
A test can still explicitly provide the necessary options instead.

</dl>

<h2 id="ACTION_TAGS">ACTION TAGS</h2>

<p>Action tags tell the harness how to perform the test.  They are executed in the
order in which they are given.  Each action either passes or fails.  If an
action fails, no following actions, if any, are performed.  A test passes if,
and only if, all of its actions pass.

<p>Action tags begin with the tag token "<code>@run</code>", and have the following syntax:

<pre style="margin-left:0.5in">
@run <var>&lt;type&gt;</var><var>&lt;option&gt;*</var> <var>&lt;arg&gt;*</var>
</pre>

<p>The <var>&lt;type&gt;</var> describes the basic type of the action; the <var>&lt;option&gt;</var>s further
describe how the action is to be performed.  The <var>&lt;arg&gt;</var>s are passed to the test
in a manner appropriate to the <var>&lt;type&gt;</var>.

<p>The first token after the "<code>@run</code>" token contains both the action type and
options, if any.  To parse the type and the options, this token is broken down
into subtokens.  A subtoken is either the character '=', the character '/', or
a maximal contiguous sequence of characters not containing either of these
characters.

<p>The type of an action tag is named by the first subtoken of the tag's first
token.  The remaining subtokens of the first token form the options.  Options
have the syntax

<p style="margin-left:0.5in">
    <code>/<var>&lt;name&gt;</var></code> &nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>/<var>&lt;name&gt;</var>=<var>&lt;value&gt;</var></code>
</p>

<p>where <var>&lt;name&gt;</var> and <var>&lt;value&gt;</var> are a single subtokens.  The <var>&lt;value&gt;</var> may be enclosed
in double quotes to prevent the usual interpretation of '=', '/', and
whitespace.


<h3 id="ACTION_OPTIONS">ACTION OPTIONS</h3>

<p>Not all action types support all options.

<dl class="tags">

<dt>/fail
<dd>
<p>Negate the result of the action.  If the action fails it is treated as though
it passed, and vice versa.

<dt>/timeout=<var>&lt;seconds&gt;</var>
<dd>
<p>Specify the timeout value.  The default timeout is two minutes.  If an action
does not finish before the timeout expires, it fails.  The timeout period
applies to the entire action, not to particular steps of the action. A value of
zero means there is no timeout. The /timeout option may not be given in
conjunction with the <code>/manual</code> option.

<dt>/ref=<var>&lt;file&gt;</var>
<dd>
<p>Capture the standard output and error of the action and compare it to the
content of <var>&lt;file&gt;</var>, which is in the same directory as the test.  The action
succeeds only if the output matches the content of the file.  Even if <code>/fail</code> is
specified, the output must match in order for the action to pass.

<dt>/othervm
<dd>
<p>Some test harnesses reuse a VM between tests.  This
option forces the action to be run in a fresh VM subprocess.  Use this option
if you need to specify VM options, or if the action might crash the VM.

<dt>/manual[=(yesno|done)]
<dd>
<p>Indicates that this is a manual action requiring user interaction.  If the
harness has been instructed to run only automatic actions, then this action
will be skipped and will be considered to have passed.  The <code>/manual</code> option may
not be given in conjunction with the <code>/timeout</code> option.

<p>If no option value is given, then the harness assumes that the test itself will
handle whatever user interaction is necessary.  If "<code>yesno</code>" is given, then the
harness will ask the user whether the action is to pass or fail.  If "<code>done</code>" is
given, then the harness will wait until the user indicates that the test has
completed.  When the harness queries the user it does so in a manner
appropriate to the action type; e.g., for applet actions it will either display
"<code>pass</code>" or "<code>fail</code>" buttons or a single "<code>done</code>" button.  In the failure case, some
harnesses may provide a way for the user to submit text describing the failure.

<dt>/policy=<var>&lt;file&gt;</var>
<dd>
<p>Define the Java system property "java.security.policy" to have the value
"<code>=${TESTSRC}/</code><var>&lt;file&gt;</var>", where TESTSRC is the name of the directory
containing the defining file of the test.  This definition has the effect of making
the given file the sole source of security policies to be used by the security manager.
In particular, the system security policy and the user's security policy will
be ignored.  If the <code>/secure</code> option is not used then the default security
manager will be installed.

<p>Property expansion will be performed in the policy file as usual; in
particular, the "<code>test.src</code>" and "<code>test.classes</code>" properties will name the source
and class directories of the test being run (see <a href="#DIRECTORY_CONTEXT">DIRECTORY CONTEXT</a> below).

<p>This option may only be used in conjunction with the <code>/othervm</code> option.

<dt>/secure=<var>&lt;class&gt;</var>
<dd>
<p>Specify a subclass of <code>java.lang.SecurityManager</code> to be installed as the security
manager.  An appropriate <code>@build</code> tag should be provided to ensure that the class
is compiled.  If the <code>/secure</code> option is used without the <code>/policy</code> option then the
system's built-in policy, equivalent to the original sandbox policy, will be
assumed.

<p>This option may only be used in conjunction with the <code>/othervm</code> option.

<dt>/native
<dd>
<p>The test uses native code, which must be provided separately, in a precompiled library,
when the test is run.

</dl>

<h3 id="CLASS_NAMES">CLASS NAMES AS ACTION ARGUMENTS</h3>

<p>Some actions take one or more class names as arguments.  Each such argument is
the name of a class, not the name of a class file, so the ".class" suffix
should not be given.

<p>A class name may be specified in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>a simple class name: e.g., "Foo"
<li>a package name followed by a simple name: e.g., "bar.Foo", "baz.bar.Foo"
<li>a module name followed by either <code>module-info</code> or a fully qualified class name:
    e.g., "myModule/module-info", "myModule/baz.bar.Foo"
</ul>
If a class in a non-Java package is specified, then the source file for that class must be in
the corresponding directory relative to the directory containing the defining
file of the test.


<h3 id="WILDCARDS">CLASS-NAME WILDCARDS</h3>

<p>Some actions take either class names or class-name wildcards as arguments.  A
class-name wildcard can be specified in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>"*", meaning all classes in the default package
<li>"<var>&lt;package-name&gt;</var>.*", meaning all classes in the named package
<li>"<var>&lt;module-name&gt;</var>/<var>&lt;package-name&gt;</var>.*", meaning all classes
    in the named package in the named module
<li>"<var>&lt;module-name&gt;</var>/*", meaning all classes in the named module
</ul>


<h3 id="ACTION_TYPES">ACTION TYPES</h3>

<dl class="tags">

<dt>build <var>&lt;classname-or-wildcard&gt;+</var>

<dd>
<p>Build classes on demand.  Each argument may be a class name, as described
above, or a class-name wildcard.  To locate a source file for a named class,
the harness takes the first matching file found by looking in the test-source
directory and then in each appropriate directory of the library path list.
To locate the source files denoted by a wildcard, the harness evaluates the
wildcard relative to test-source directory and relative to each directory of
the library path list, taking all matches.  Each discovered class will be
compiled if its corresponding class file does not exist or is older than its
source file.  Intended primarily for use before main and applet actions that
require more than one class to be compiled.  Passes only if the compiler
finishes without error, or if none of the specified classes need to be
compiled.

<p>It is an error for a build action to be the last action in a test description.

<dt>clean <var>&lt;classname-or-wildcard&gt;+</var>

<dd>
<p>Remove the class files for the named classes, if they exist.  Each argument may
be a class name or a class-name wildcard.  Intended primarily for compiler
tests.  Always passes.

<dt>compile[/fail][/ref=<var>&lt;file&gt;</var>][/timeout=<var>&lt;seconds&gt;</var>][/process][/module=<var>&lt;module-name&gt;</var>] <var>&lt;arg&gt;+</var>
<dd>
<p>Invoke the compiler on the given <var>&lt;arg&gt;</var>s, which may include any compiler option
other than the "<code>-d</code>" option.  Equivalent to "javac <var>&lt;arg&gt;+</var>", therefore to specify
source files the ".java" suffix must be included.  Source file names should be
relative pathnames using forward slashes and ".." to denote parent directories;
they are normally interpreted relative to the directory containing the defining file of
the test.  Standard output and standard error are concatenated (not
interleaved) so that <code>/ref</code> may be used.  Intended primarily for compiler tests;
non-compiler tests should generally use build actions.  The timeout period, if
specified, applies to the entire compile action, not to the compilation of each
individual source file.  Passes only if the compiler finishes without error.

<p>The <code>/process</code> option can be given to indicate that the compilation
includes the use of an annotation processor and that no source files are being compiled.
If <code>/process</code> is not given, at least one source file must be specified.

<p>The <code>/module=<var>&lt;module-name&gt;</var></code> option is used to compile
a patch for a module in the system image. In this one situation, the source files must be in
a subdirectory named for the module, relative to the directory containing the defining
file of the test. Neither the module directory nor the list of source files may contain
a <code>module-info.java</code> file.
Internally, this option corresponds to using the javac
<code>--patch-module=<var>&lt;module-name&gt;</var>=<var>&lt;path&gt;</var></code> option.

<p>User modules can be compiled by placing the code for the modules in subdirectories
named for the modules. Each directory should have a corresponding <code>module-info.java</code>
file.No other options are required: in particular, <code>/module=<var>&lt;module-name&gt;</var></code>
should <i>not</i> be used; that option is just used for patches to system modules.
To avoid confusion, it is highly recommended that tests containing user modules should be placed
in their own directory, and should not contain any other directories apart from the directories
used to contain module source code.

<p>The use of the <code>-classpath</code> and <code>-sourcepath</code> options as arguments to the compile
action is discouraged; the <code>@library</code> tag is often more appropriate.

<p>Invoke the main method of the specified class, passing any arguments after the
class name.  Roughly equivalent to "java <var>&lt;vm-opt&gt;*</var> <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> <var>&lt;arg&gt;*</var>".  All
initial argument tokens beginning with a dash are considered to be VM options;
the first argument not beginning with a dash is the <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> to be invoked, and
any remaining arguments are passed to the main method of that class.  Passes
only if the main method returns normally and does not cause an exception to be
thrown, from the main thread or from any other thread.  A "main" action is
considered to be finished when the main method returns; if a test involves
multiple threads, some synchronization may be necessary to ensure that the
other threads finish their work before the thread running the main method
returns.

<p>Sometimes, after the main method has been invoked, the code may determine
that it cannot execute the test as required, and as such, the test should not
be considered to have either passed or failed. In this situation, the test may
throw an exception named `jtreg.SkippedException`, optionally providing
a detail string to indicate why the test has been skipped.

<p>The named <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> will be compiled on demand, just as though an "<code>@run</code> build
<var>&lt;class&gt;</var>" action had been inserted before this action.  If this action requires
classes other than <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> to be up to date, insert an appropriate build action
before this action.  If any <var>&lt;vm-opt&gt;</var>s are given then <code>/othervm</code> should be
specified.  If the <code>/manual</code> option is specified then the harness will skip this
action when instructed to run only automatic tests; no arguments to the <code>/manual</code>
option are supported.

<p>The use of the <code>-classpath</code> option as an argument to a <code>main/othervm</code> action is
discouraged; the <code>@library</code> tag is often more appropriate.  The setting of the
system properties "<code>java.security.manager</code>" and "<code>java.security.policy</code>" in
<code>main/othervm</code> actions is also discouraged; the <code>/policy</code> and <code>/secure</code> options
should be used instead.

<dd>
<p>Invoke the main method of the specified class, passing any arguments after the class name.
Although superficially similar to <code>@run main</code>, this is for use when
it is desirable to perform additional setup or configuration before running
the class containing the actual test code, possibly in a child VM.

<p>The named <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> will be compiled on demand, just as though an "<code>@run</code> build
<var>&lt;class&gt;</var>" action had been inserted before this action.  If this action requires

<dd>
<p>Invoke the specified class as a JUnit 4.5 test.  Roughly equivalent to "<code>@run
main org.junit.runner.JUnitCore <var>&lt;class&gt;</var></code>".  All initial argument tokens
beginning with a dash are considered to be VM options; the first argument not
beginning with a dash is the <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> to be invoked.  No additional arguments
are allowed.  Passes only if the main method of JUnitCore returns normally and
does not cause an exception to be thrown, from the main thread or from any
other thread.  As with a "main" action, a "junit" action is considered to be
finished when the main method of JUnitCore returns.

<p>The named <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> will be compiled on demand, just as though an "<code>@run</code> build
<var>&lt;class&gt;</var>" action had been inserted before this action.  If this action requires
classes other than <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> to be up to date, insert an appropriate build action
before this action.  If any <var>&lt;vm-opt&gt;</var>s are given then <code>/othervm</code> should be
specified.

<p>The use of the <code>@library</code> tag, and of the <code>/othervm</code>, <code>/manual</code>, <code>/policy</code>, and <code>/secure</code>
options, are the same for a "junit" action as for a "main" action; see above.

<p>In order to use a "junit" action, the JUnit 4.5 jar file may need to be placed
manually alongside the jtreg and javatest jar files in the jtreg installation.
If junit.jar file is not found, and if no class named <code>org.junit.runner.JUnitCore</code>
can be found, any "junit" actions will fail, regardless of whether the <code>/fail</code>
option was selected.

<p>This action executes all the tests in a single JUnit test file.  All the tests
in that one file will be grouped as a single jtreg test for reporting purposes.

<dd>
<p>Invoke the specified class as a TestNG test.  Roughly equivalent to "<code>@run
    main org.testng.TestNG <var>&lt;class&gt;</var></code>".  All initial argument tokens
beginning with a dash are considered to be VM options; the first argument not
beginning with a dash is the <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> to be invoked.  No additional arguments
are allowed.  Passes only if the main method of TestNG returns normally and
does not cause an exception to be thrown, from the main thread or from any
other thread.  As with a "main" action, a "testng" action is considered to be
finished when the main method of TestNG returns.

<p>The named <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> will be compiled on demand, just as though an "<code>@run</code> build
<var>&lt;class&gt;</var>" action had been inserted before this action.  If this action requires
classes other than <var>&lt;class&gt;</var> to be up to date, insert an appropriate build action
before this action.  If any <var>&lt;vm-opt&gt;</var>s are given then <code>/othervm</code> should be
specified.

<p>The use of the <code>@library</code> tag, and of the <code>/othervm</code>, <code>/manual</code>, <code>/policy</code>, and <code>/secure</code>
options, are the same for a "testng" action as for a "main" action; see above.

<p>In order to use a "testng" action, the TestNG jar file may need to be placed
manually alongside the jtreg and javatest jar files in the jtreg installation.
If testng.jar file is not found, and if no class named <code>org.testng.TestNG</code>
can be found, any "testng" actions will fail, regardless of whether the <code>/fail</code>
option was selected.

<p>This action executes all the tests in a single TestNG test file.  All the tests
in that one file will be grouped as a single jtreg test for reporting purposes.

<p>Note: this action allows individual tests to be written as TestNG tests,
and placed alongside other tests using other combinations of actions.
See <a href="#TESTNG">below</a> for details on how to set up a directory
containing only standard TestNG tests.

<dt>applet[/fail][/manual[=(yesno|done)]][/othervm][/policy=<var>&lt;file&gt;</var>]
        [/secure=<var>&lt;class&gt;</var>][/timeout=<var>&lt;sec&gt;</var>] <var>&lt;html-file&gt;</var>
<dd>
<p>Run the applet described by the first <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> HTML tag in the given
<var>&lt;html-file&gt;</var>, ignoring any other <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tags.  The applet action is roughly
equivalent to "appletviewer <var>&lt;html-file&gt;</var>"; the major difference is that the
applet is not run in the restricted security environment implemented by the
appletviewer.  Intended primarily for tests of graphics functionality; tests of
the appletviewer itself can be written using shell actions.  Passes if the
applet does not throw any exceptions from any thread and, if the <code>/manual</code> option
is specified with a value of "<code>yesno</code>", the user indicates that the test passes.

<p>The class named in the <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag will be compiled on demand, just as though
an "<code>@run</code> build <var>&lt;class&gt;</var>" action had been inserted before this action.  If this
action requires classes other the class named in the <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag to be
up to date, insert an appropriate build action before this action.

<p>If <code>/manual</code> is not specified, then the applet will be run by invoking its <code>init</code>,
<code>start</code>, and <code>setVisible(true)</code> methods (in that order), delaying for a few
seconds, and then invoking its stop and destroy methods (in that order).

<p>The <code>/manual</code> option may be specified to indicate that the test requires human
interaction.  In this case the HTML file itself will be displayed; it should
contain any instructions for the user.  When displaying the HTML file, a
harness may or may not interpret HTML tags other than the <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag; thus
the instructions should be written in a way that does not depend upon HTML
rendering.

<p>If <code>/manual</code> is specified alone, i.e., without any value argument, then the
applet will be run just as in the non-manual case.  The harness will skip this
action, and treat it as though it had passed, when instructed to run only
automatic tests.

<p>If <code>/manual=yesno</code> is specified, then the harness will ask the user whether the
test passes or fails, typically by displaying "<code>pass</code>" and "<code>fail</code>" buttons.  The
applet will be run by invoking its <code>init</code>, <code>start</code>, and <code>setVisible(true)</code> methods
(in that order), waiting for the user to click on "<code>pass</code>" or "<code>fail</code>", and then
invoking the applet's <code>stop</code> and <code>destroy</code> methods (in that order).

<p>If <code>/manual=done</code> is specified, then the harness will wait for the user to
indicate that the test is complete, typically by displaying a "<code>done</code>" button.
The applet will be run by invoking its <code>init</code>, <code>start</code>, and <code>setVisible(true)</code>
methods (in that order), waiting for the user to click on "<code>done</code>", and then
invoking the applet's <code>stop</code> and <code>destroy</code> methods (in that order).

<p>The setting of the system properties "<code>java.security.manager</code>" and
"<code>java.security.policy</code>" in applet/othervm actions is also discouraged; the
<code>/policy</code> and <code>/secure</code> options should be used instead.


<dt>shell[/fail][/manual][/timeout=<var>&lt;seconds&gt;</var>] <var>&lt;script&gt;</var> <var>&lt;arg&gt;*</var>
<dd>
<p>Invoke the Bourne shell to run <var>&lt;script&gt;</var> on the given <var>&lt;arg&gt;</var>s.  The <var>&lt;script&gt;</var>
argument should the name of a file relative to the test source directory (see
below), using "/" to separate directories and ".." to refer to parent
directories.  Passes only if the script exits with an exit status of 0.

<p>Various test-specific environment variables will be set, giving details about the test itself:
see <a href="#testvars">Appendix 2</a> for details.
Various system environment variables will also be set: see <a href="#envvars">Appendix 3</a> for details.

<p>If the <code>/manual</code> option is specified then the harness will skip this
action when instructed to run only automatic tests; no arguments to the <code>/manual</code>
option are supported.

<dt>ignore <var>&lt;word&gt;*</var>
<dd>
<p>Ignore this and all following <code>@run</code> tags.  A test harness may treat this test as
a failure or as some other type of error.  The <var>&lt;word&gt;</var> tokens, if any, should
describe why the test is being ignored.  These tokens may be displayed by the
harness in some appropriate fashion.
</dl>

<h2 id="ORDER">ORDER OF TAGS</h2>

<p>The following is the recommended order for the tags in a test description:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>@test</code></li>
    <li><code>@bug</code></li>
    <li><code>@summary</code></li>
    <li><code>@key</code></li>
    <li><code>@requires</code></li>
    <li><code>@modules</code></li>
    <li><code>@library</code></li>
    <li><i>action tags, in the order to be executed</i></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="TESTNG">TESTNG</h2>

<p>A directory within the source directory structure may be configured to
be the root of a set of TestNG tests. When so configured, all Java source
files in or under the directory are considered to be defining files, and
thus considered to be a test to be executed. If a file has a leading comment,
the comment may only contain informative tags and declarative tags, and
may not contain any action tags.

<p>Each test within the set is deemed to have any implicit <code>@build</code>
action specifying all the Java source files in the set, followed by an
implicit action to execute the test as a TestNG test.

<h2 id="DIRECTORY_CONTEXT">DIRECTORY CONTEXT</h2>

<p>Each test is run in a context that defines the following directories.
<dl class="terms">
<dt>
Working directory
<dd>The directory in which the harness is running.
<dt>
Source directory
<dd>The directory containing the defining file of the test,
as well as any associated files (e.g., input data files).  Generally not
the same as the working directory.
<dt>
Class directory
<dd>The directory into which class files compiled from source
files in the source directory are compiled.  It may be the source directory,
or it may be some other directory.
<dt>
Java home directory
<dd>The directory containing the JDK build or release
being tested.
</dl>

<p>A test may create temporary files in the working directory as needed.  Test
harnesses will typically delete such files before or after each test is run.
In order to work properly when run standalone, however, tests should not rely
upon this behavior.  This can be done having each test's initialization code
delete any files that the test may have created in a previous invocation.

<p>For each source directory in the test hierarchy there is a corresponding class
directory, which may or may not the same as the source directory.  Classes in
different source directories are, therefore, in different name spaces and
their names will not collide.  Simple test harnesses may place class files in
source directories, while more sophisticated harnesses will generally place
class files in a parallel directory hierarchy.

<p>The names of the source, class, and Java home directories of a test are made
available to shell-action scripts via the environment variables <code>TESTSRC</code>,
<code>TESTCLASSES</code>, and <code>TESTJAVA</code>, respectively.  The directory names do not have
trailing separators.

<p>The names of the source and class directories of a test are made available to
main and applet actions via the system properties "test.src" and
"test.classes", respectively.  The directory names do not have trailing
separators.  Main and applet actions can read data files defined in the test's
source directory using this idiom:

<pre class="example">
File f = new File(System.getProperty("test.src", "."), "foo");
InputStream in = new FileInputStream(f);
</pre>

<p>By defaulting the directory to ".", this technique allows the test to be run
standalone in its source directory.

<h2 id="TEST_GROUPS">TEST GROUPS</h2>

<p>Groups are defined in a test suite using one or more Java
properties files. The names of these files must be listed in
the "<code>groups</code>" entry in <a href="#TEST_ROOT">TEST.ROOT</a>.
If the filename is enclosed in square brackets, no error message
will be given if the file cannot be found. Within the property files,
each entry specifies items to be included or excluded from the group.
<ul>
<li>To include a test or directory of tests, simply specify the
name of the test or directory.
<li>To exclude a test or directory of tests, use '-' followed by the
name of the test or directory.
There must be no spaces between the "-" and the name that follows.
<li>To include the contents of another group, use ':' followed by the name of the group.
There must be no spaces between the ":" and the name that follows.
</ul>

<h2 id="SOURCE_STRUCTURE">SOURCE-DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND
<span id="config">TEST-SUITE CONFIGURATION FILES</span></h2>

<p>This specification places few constraints upon the structure of a tree of source
directories.  Some test harnesses may be able to provide more robust behavior or
more succinct reports when they can identify the root of such a tree.  The root
of a test-source tree must therefore be identified by placing a file named
TEST.ROOT in the root directory.  Exactly one such file must exist in every
test-source tree.

<h3 id="TEST_ROOT_PROPERTIES">TEST.ROOT and TEST.properties</h3>

<p>The <span id="TEST_ROOT">TEST.ROOT</span> file contains test-suite configuration
information. It is in the standard Java property-file format as described in the
specification of the <code>java.util.Properties</code> class.
Properties defined in this file apply to the entire test suite.
Additional properties files named TEST.properties may appear in subdirectories
of the test suite, and may be used to provide additional configuration values
that apply to files in that directory and its subdirectories.

<p>The following properties may only appear in TEST.ROOT:

<dl>
<dt id="checkBugId"><code>checkBugId true|false</code>
<dd><p>Whether or not to check the format of strings in @bug tags.
Checking is disabled if this property is set to <code>false</code>.</p>

<dt id="defaultExecMode"><code>defaultExecMode agentvm|othervm|samevm</code>
<dd><p>The default execution mode for tests in the test suite.
A harness that supports multiple test execution modes may use
this value to determine the default execution mode for tests in
this test-suite.</p>

<dt id="groups"><code>groups <var>&lt;files&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>Where to find group definition files.
A space separated list of files. Optional files should be enclosed in
square brackets.</p>

<dt id="requiredVersion"><code>requiredVersion <var>&lt;version&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>Minimal version of the harness required for this test-suite.
A version string in the format "[0-9.]+ ?b[0-9]+" (without the quotes). For example
a value of "4.1 b03" declares that at least that version of the harness is required
to run all the tests in the test suite.</p>

<dt id="requires.extraPropDefns"><code>requires.extraPropDefns <var>&lt;source-files&gt;</var></code><br>
<dd><p>This option is used to provide source files for classes that will be used at the
beginning of each test suite run, to determine additional characteristics of the system for
use with the <code>@requires</code> tag. Each class must implement
<code>java.util.concurrent.Callable&lt;java.util.Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;</code>.
When invoked, the <code>call()</code> method should return properties that can be referenced in
an expression in a <code>@requires</code> tag. <i>Note:</i> the names of the
new properties that may be returned by calling these classes must also be declared in
a <code>requires.properties</code> entry. If an error occurs while computing a value,
the value may be set to the special value <code>__ERROR__</code>, optionally followed by
a short explanation of the error that occurred.
<p>If this option is specified, the following additional options may also be specified:
<ul>
<li><code>requires.extraPropDefns.libs <var>&lt;source-files&gt;</var></code>
    &mdash; source files for classes that will be put on the classpath when the
    primary classes are run.
<li><code>requires.extraPropDefns.bootlibs <var>&lt;source-files&gt;</var></code>
    &mdash; source files for classes that will be put on the bootclasspath when the
    primary classes are run.
<li><code>requires.extraPropDefns.javacOpts <var>&lt;options&gt;</var></code>
    &mdash; options that will be passed to javac when the source files are compiled.
<li><code>requires.extraPropDefns.vmOpts <var>&lt;options&gt;</var></code>
    &mdash; options that will be passed to VM when the classes are executed.
</ul>
<p>In this family of options, if a source file is enclosed in square brackets, no error message
will be given if the file is not available.
</dl>

<p>The following properties may appear in either TEST.ROOT or any TEST.properties file:

<dl>
<dt id="keys"><code>keys <var>&lt;keywords&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>The set of valid keywords that can be used in @key tags.
A harness that supports keyword-based test selection should reject any test
containing keywords that are not present in this list.
If this property is not present then no keywords should be accepted.</p>

<dt id="bootclasspath.dirs"><code>bootclasspath.dirs <var>&lt;directories&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>Directories that when used should be placed on the bootclasspath.</p>

<dt><code>othervm.dirs <var>&lt;directories&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>Directories containing tests which should all be run in othervm mode.
A harness that supports multiple test execution modes should ensure
that all tests in the specified directories are run in <code>othervm</code>
mode.</p>

<dt id="exclusiveAccess.dirs"><code>exclusiveAccess.dirs <var>&lt;directories&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>Directories containing tests which should not be run concurrently at
the same time as other tests.
A harness that supports concurrent test execution should ensure

<dt id="lib.build"><code>lib.build <var>&lt;build-arguments&gt;</var></code>
<dd><p>Default library components that will be built by tests in TestNG directories
in or under the directory containing this property declaration.
The values should be of a form that can be accepted by an <code>@build</code> tag.
If not specified, the entire contents of any currently specified libraries will
be built.</p>

<dt id="external.lib.roots"><code>external.lib.roots <var>&lt;directories&gt;</var></code>

<dt id="requires.properties"><code>requires.properties <var>&lt;property-name&gt;+</var></code>
<dd>Declare property names that may be used in a <code>@requires</code> expression.

family of configuration values.

<dt id="maxOutputSize"><code>maxOutputSize <var>&lt;int-value&gt;</var></code>
<dd>Override the default limit for the amount of output that will be
saved on any stream being recorded by the test harness. For jtreg, the default

<dt id="allowSmartActionArgs"><code>allowSmartActionArgs <var>&lt;true|false&gt;</var></code>
<dd>Specify whether to permit the use of <code>${<var>&lt;name&gt;</var></code>

When any action is run, environment variables that may be required by various
system components will be set.

<p>On Unix systems, the <code>PATH</code> will be set to <code>/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</code>
and the following variables will be propagated if they are set:

<ul>
<li><code>DISPLAY</code>,
<li><code>GNOME_DESKTOP_SESSION_ID</code>,
<li><code>HOME</code>,
<li><code>LANG</code>,
<li><code>LC_ALL</code>,
<li><code>LC_CTYPE</code>,
<li><code>LPDEST</code>,
<li><code>PRINTER</code>,
<li><code>TZ</code> and
<li><code>XMODIFIERS</code>.
</ul>

<p>On Windows systems, the following variables will be propagated if they are set:
