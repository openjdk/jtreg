# This test is a followup to Basic.othervm, and depends on the output from
# test for its data. Basic.othervm adapts its behavior depending on whether
# it is running in a headless environment, as determined by
# java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless(). (See Basic.java, line 59)
# This value is reported in the log that is written by Basic.java.
# Because this test is a report of the tests executed in Basic.othervm,
# we check that setting and adapt the behavior here accordingly.
