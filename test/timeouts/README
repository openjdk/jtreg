This directory provides a collection of tests designed to exercise jtreg's 
ability to handle tests that do not return or which kill the VM in which 
they are executing.

The tests can be run locally via the build/TimeoutTest.ok target.
They can also be run on the JDK team's JPRT build-and-test system
by executing make/jprt-timeout.sh.
