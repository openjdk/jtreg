## Using IntelliJ IDEA

The `jtreg` repo also contains a plugin for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
This is a convenience plugin which adds `jtreg` capabilities to the IDE.
With this plugin, OpenJDK developers can write, run, and debug `jtreg` tests
without leaving their IDE environment.  For more details, see the file
[plugins/idea/README.md](plugins/idea/README.md) in this repo.
